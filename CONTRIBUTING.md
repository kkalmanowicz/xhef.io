# Contributing to xhef.io

We love your input! We want to make contributing to xhef.io as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests Welcome

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/kkalmanowicz/xhef-io/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy environment variables: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Set up your Supabase credentials
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Make your changes
7. Test your changes thoroughly
8. Submit a pull request

## Code Style

* Use TypeScript where possible
* Follow existing code conventions
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Comment complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused
* Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)

## Commit Messages

Please use clear and meaningful commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/kkalmanowicz/xhef-io/issues/new) to discuss new features before implementing them.
